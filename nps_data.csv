It takes a long time to change channels. Sometimes the TV lags a lot and when we turn it on it's just a big green screen that says 'Loading'.  Many times the screen is pixelated and we can't watch anything. 3. Overall, after the recent switch from cable to optic fiber and installation of a new set top box, the experience has been very negative.  The problems must be fixed.

U don't want to get urself involved with a problem that ur customers are facing? Or is it that ur different department belong to another company that both cannot communicate??? 3. Do u think u want a service provider like what I mentioned above?

22256050,Singapore,West,"Firstly. The service is a far cry from my previous  ISP. I felt the media box very very cheap. In my experience with media box, it is very very unpleasant. It is very laggy. Keep having hang issues. Had I know it's this kinda media box setup, I will stick with SingTel.   Price plan is very ex compared to SingTel. Additional feature I have to top up with $. This is so expensive. With same price, I can access UCL and BPL / FA cup. Now only able to watch bpl. Very disappointing.   Extra services such as Disney+ was promised to me but eventually said I not entitled cos I did not fulfil the criteria! Very disappointing",0,11556

Unless it was for a very good reason, please don't do that!  Please don't lock or disable features!  As far as my plan goes, it's really irritating that I was forced into your Disney+ deal with no alternatives.  It's one thing to offer a carrot for people who might want this.  It's quite another to shove that carrot up every customer whether they want it or not.  If you signed some deal with Disney agreeing to force all users to take a deal, then that's borderline corruption.

Results in slow speed instead Starhub always ask consumers to upgrade to higher broadband which is useless coz it is the incoming that cannot cope with the demand.

I already have a google wifi mesh (from starhub) and recontracting will require me to install another nokia mesh (required for free to air tv on tv+). This forces me to recontract to the 2 gbps plan.. but this breaks my smart home infrastructure as now i will have 2 separate networks (stipulated by starhub that the 2 gbps must be split into 1 + 1) esp if i want to ensure enough bandwidth for my other activities. This makes makes solutions convoluted and expensive. Thus, it is very difficult to recommend starhub to family or friends as this will subject them to a world of headaches and a bad experience.
